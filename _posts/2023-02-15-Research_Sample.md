I visited Dongxiang in 2016. It was, and still is the poorest county in China. Most people there were categoried as Dongxiang ethnicity, whose language is very similar to Mongolian, but believe in Islam. 
The research we conducted here was simple, but the result was published as reports and an simple article on a Chinese journal. 

* This is Dongxiang
