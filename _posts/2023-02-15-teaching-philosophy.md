### Inclusion 
Inclusion in my class has two folds of meanings. First, I would pay attention to the needs of students with various educational backgrounds, learning abilities, and learning modalities. For example, I would remember all names and faces of students in my class as soon as possible so that I could follow their progress and responses in my classroom. In the meantime, I encourage discussion between students to help engage those who are less active to keep up with the class's progress. 
Secondly, I also hope the mindset of students could be more inclusive after taking my course. The content of human geography courses encourages inclusive thinking, as these courses care about problems human society faces today, such as development, justice, and economic growth. 
I, too, follow this principle in my methods class. In my Geography Information Systems (GIS) course,  I often use examples from other US states and countries and make the GIS analysis relevant to real-world problems, such as diseases, climate change, and urban equity. For instance, the most recent example I used for buffer analysis is the service coverage of grocery stores. This will help the students realize the severity of food desert issues in the US.  

### Rationality
The other principle of mine is to deliver the teaching of rationality. I'm aware that education is not just about the indoctrination of skills and knowledge. Instead, college education should let students become self-sufficient learners to explore, discuss, and construct concepts and relationships in contexts involving real-world problems.
In other words, beyond understanding my teaching content, my students should know the connection between different ideas and obtain a geographic perspective of thinking. They should also know the significance of what they have learned: why they should know. It is particularly essential for those courses concentrating on a particular region, such as the Geography of North America or the Geography of Asia. In these courses, I encourage the students to form a framework of their knowledge structure and comprehend the cause of these regions' challenges. Therefore, they would also enhance their ability to apply their knowledge to other fields of learning.  
To uphold this principle, I will use carefully designed quizzes to guide their learning and ensure each lesson's content is valuable to all students. I've learned to be student-centered and give my students a voice. Listening to my colleagues and advisors' suggestions, and accepting student feedback, will improve my overall teaching, and I will continue to do so in my professional career.
