I was passionated about data scrapping techniques during the first a few years of my MSU life. 
With API, data scrapping can be easy, and servers friendly. 

### API data scrapping, examples: 
If a website provide API for you to load data from their backpage, a simpler package like *urllib*- should be good enough to use.

### BeautifulSoup
I like this package because BeautifulSoup can extract the useful element from a webpage in a very structuralized way. 

### Selenium
sometimes, the data is too difficult to get. Selenium is the ultimate tool that we can use. Because Selenium actually will turn an internet explorer on, you can actually monitor the process of scrapping.

### Muti-tread Scrapping
If the structure of data is good, and you are confident about the codes you used, try muti-treads scrapping. It is faster.
