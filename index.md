Hi, I am Teng, a Ph.D. candidate about to graduate from [Michigan State University](https://https://geo.msu.edu/) where I worked with Professors Siddharth Chandra and Ashton Shortridge. My research areas are in applied spatial data analysis, digital humanity, and urban/environmental economic geography. 

Right now, I am completing my dissertation project, [*Unsafe Place: Spatial Analysis of Indonesian Genocide 1965-1966 in Java Timur*](/Indonesia), which uses innovative spatial quantitative techniques to answer three vital research questions about genocide: where, who, and how. 

Aside from my academic pursuits, I have shared my knowledge and passion with students through the art of teaching, imparting the intricacies of Intermediate GIS, World Regional Geography, and GIS Technology. I am now in the midst of creating syllabi for new classes, hoping to delve into the fascinating fields of Human Geography and Geography of Violence.

My journey to becoming a Michigander started as a senior analyst at Jones Lang LaSalle in Guangzhou, China, where I roamed the land and explored a multitude of real estate marvels: towering apartments, sprawling warehouses, bustling office buildings, and vibrant shopping centers. My experiences there continue to influence and inspire me in my research and analytical projects.

When not immersed in work, I embrace my wanderlust and embark on adventures, with Peru and Bolivia next on my bucket list of places to visit.
