excerpt: "Three researches about the mass killing event 60 years ago..."
---

## Background
The Indonesian Communist Purge was one of the most massive genocides in human history. The victims of the purge were members of the Indonesian Communist Party and their so-called sympathizers. The persecutors included the Indonesian Army and local militias. While the army followed orders from Surabaya’s Commander, the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) party supported local militias because they held long-term resentments toward the communist party. The following research aims to distinguish the different impacts of the two types of persecutors on the magnitude of the purge and find which one played the fundamental role in the killing. 

The research uses the distance between a settlement and the local army command or the Islamic boarding school (supported by the NU) to depict the magnitude of their local impact. In addition, this research further disaggregated the district level data to create a finer level unit of analysis to detect sub district level factor’s influence. The result indicates that both the army and the NU significantly impacted the purge, but overall, the army has played a more fundamental role. <strike>Both</strike> the army and the NU’s impact generally declines as the physical distance toward them increases, while the influence of the army covers a much larger area than the NU.

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Albert Einstein's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.

Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

### Figures (for images or video)

#### One Up

<figure>
	<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_c.jpg"></a>

Mustache cillum irony, fingerstache magna pour-over keffiyeh tousled selfies.

#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>


Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

<figure style="width: 150px" class="align-left">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Itty-bitty caption.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

<figure style="width: 1200px">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Massive image comment for your eyeballs.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

<figure style="width: 300px" class="align-right">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Feels good to be right all the time.</figcaption>
</figure>
