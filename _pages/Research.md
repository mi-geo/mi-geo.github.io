    title: "Environment Policy and Empirical Result of Air Quality in China"
    excerpt: "The capability, pressure, and resistance to enforce environmental regulations would determine the result of air quality. This study investigated the air quality across 86 major Chinese cities and observed that between 2001 and 2011, air quality showed an overall improvement, although with substantial discrepancies across cities.\
	Using a panel data regression model, this study revealed that inadequate capability and strong opposition towards enforcing stringent environmental regulations were pivotal factors contributing to environmental degradation in urban China. Moreover, the study concluded that social pressure had a negligible impact on improving urban air quality.\

    title: "Transiting spatial structure of post-soviet walled residential compound"
    excerpt: "*Danwei* compounds (work-unit) constituted the predominant type of urban neighborhood. Subsequent to the economic reforms, the role of these compounds has experienced significant changes. This research undertakes an exploration of the conceptualization of property rights redistribution and spatial evolution in post-danwei compounds. 
	The trend towards the private appropriation of all types of compound resources by these users has brought about the spatial evolution of the compound, characterized by the reuse of former amenities, fragmented spaces, porous boundaries, the evolution of street shops, and the encroachment of public space.\
