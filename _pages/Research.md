    title: "Environment Policy and Empirical Result of Air Quality in China"
    excerpt: 'The capability, pressure, and resistance to enforce environmental regulations would determine the result of air quality. This study investigated the air quality across 86 major Chinese cities and observed that between 2001 and 2011, air quality showed an overall improvement, although with substantial discrepancies across cities.
	Using a panel data regression model, this study revealed that inadequate capability and strong opposition towards enforcing stringent environmental regulations were pivotal factors contributing to environmental degradation in urban China. Moreover, the study concluded that social pressure had a negligible impact on improving urban air quality. The findings suggest that economic development and structural transformation have diminished the bargaining power of regulated actors in local economies with respect to the environment.'

    title: "Transiting spatial structure of post-soviet walled residential compound"
    excerpt: "*Danwei* compounds (work-unit) constituted the predominant type of urban neighborhood. Subsequent to the economic reforms, the role of these compounds has experienced significant changes. This research undertakes an exploration of the conceptualization of property rights redistribution and spatial evolution in post-danwei compounds. As danwei compounds undergo transformation, property rights have come to be perceived with increasing prominence, particularly with regard to land parcels, amenities, and housing. 
	Furthermore, a more diversified group of property users, comprising both original residents and newcomers, are accorded a share of these property rights. The trend towards the private appropriation of all types of compound resources by these users has brought about the spatial evolution of the compound, characterized by the reuse of former amenities, fragmented spaces, porous boundaries, the evolution of street shops, and the encroachment of public space. 
	This study posits that the institutional and proprietary framework of post-danwei compounds is poorly defined and disorderly, leading to a weakened pattern of residual claims and the decline of these compounds. To address this issue, the study suggests the formulation of an updated contract pertaining to danwei compounds that can effectively regulate the behavior of property users."
